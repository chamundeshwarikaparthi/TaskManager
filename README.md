#Task Manager

The project's initial goal was to create a user-friendly task management webpage that would aid 
users in effectively managing their daily tasks. In order to enhance the website's functioning and 
design, we found multiple usability concerns throughout the semester and used a variety of 
usability heuristics.

I discovered that user interface design is an iterative process and that successful user 
experiences require constant review and revision. We also learned that the website's design 
should prioritize the needs and goals of the user while focusing on simplicity and usability.

I found that giving users feedback was one of the most important design elements. When 
interacting with the website, users anticipate getting a response right away. Users can better 
comprehend the effects of their actions and feel more in control of their work by receiving 
feedback.
