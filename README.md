# TaskManager


Task management webpage 
aims to provide a straightforward 
and user-friendly interface for 
successfully managing tasks without 
the need for in-depth training or 
specialized knowledge.

Task classification, analyzing 
progress, and status, and handling 
multiple tasks are some of the 
important use cases that our website 
supports to assist customers in 
staying on top of their projects and 
meeting deadlines. 

The website strives to boost 
productivity, lessen stress, and 
ultimately assist users in achieving 
their goals more rapidly by 
streamlining the task management 
process.



The project's initial goal was to create a user-friendly task management webpage that would aid 
users in effectively managing their daily tasks. In order to enhance the website's functioning and 
design, we found multiple usability concerns throughout the semester and used a variety of 
usability heuristics.

I discovered that user interface design is an iterative process and that successful user 
experiences require constant review and revision. We also learned that the website's design 
should prioritize the needs and goals of the user while focusing on simplicity and usability.

I found that giving users feedback was one of the most important design elements. When 
interacting with the website, users anticipate getting a response right away. Users can better 
comprehend the effects of their actions and feel more in control of their work by receiving 
feedback.
